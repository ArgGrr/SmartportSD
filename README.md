I have added some code to support a small OLED display to show some information, rework the code a little for better or worse.

Includes a 3d printable DB15 plug housing for the smartport. You will need some real pins.

Also includes a work in progress case that somewhat looks like a 3.5 inch unidisk drive, from pictures anyway.

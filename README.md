Added here for convenience, not intending to take over the project!

I have added some code to support a small OLED display to show some information, rework the code a little for better or worse.

Includes a 3d printable DB15 plug housing for the smartport. You will need some real pins.

Also includes a work in progress case that somewhat looks like a 3.5 inch unidisk drive, from pictures anyway.

To build you'll need to install the U8g2 library from Arduino Library Manager.
I am using the following screen: Geekcreit 0.91 Inch 128x32 IIC I2C Blue OLED Display DIY Oled Module SSD1306 Driver.
